# Section III - SELECT

### 3.1: Selecting all columns

```sql
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER;
```


To limit the number of records returned, use a LIMIT. To limit the results to just 2 records:

```sql
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER LIMIT 2;
```

### 3.2: Selecting specific columns

```sql
SELECT CUSTOMER_ID, NAME FROM CUSTOMER;
```

### 3.3: Expressions

First, select everything from `PRODUCT`

```sql
SELECT * FROM PRODUCT;
```

You can use expressions by declaring a `TAXED_PRICE`. This is not a column, but rather something that is calculated every time this query is executed.

```sql
SELECT PRODUCT_ID,
DESCRIPTION,
PRICE,
PRICE * 1.07 AS TAXED_PRICE
FROM PRODUCT;
```

> In SQliteStudio, you can hit CTRL + SPACE on Windows and Linux to show an autocomplete box with available fields. For Mac, you will need to enable that configuration in preferences.

You can also use aliases to declare an `UNTAXED_PRICE` column off the `PRICE`, without any expression.

```sql
SELECT PRODUCT_ID,
DESCRIPTION,
PRICE as UNTAXED_PRICE,
PRICE * 1.07 AS TAXED_PRICE
FROM PRODUCT;
```

### 3.4: Using `round()` Function

```sql
SELECT PRODUCT_ID,
DESCRIPTION,
PRICE,
round(PRICE * 1.07, 2) AS TAXED_PRICE

FROM PRODUCT;
```

### 3.5: Text Concatenation

You can slap a dollar sign to our result using concatenation.

```sql
SELECT PRODUCT_ID,
DESCRIPTION,
PRICE AS UNTAXED_PRICE,
'$' || round(PRICE * 1.07, 2) AS TAXED_PRICE
FROM PRODUCT
```

You can merge text via concatenation. For instance, you can concatenate two fields and put a comma and space ` ,` in between.

```sql
SELECT NAME,
CITY || ', ' || STATE AS LOCATION
FROM CUSTOMER;
```

You can concatenate several fields to create an address.

```sql
SELECT NAME,
STREET_ADDRESS || ' ' || CITY || ', ' || STATE || ' ' || ZIP AS SHIP_ADDRESS
FROM CUSTOMER;
```

This works with any data types, like numbers, texts, and dates. Also note that some platforms use `concat()` function instead of double pipes `||`

## 3.6: Comments

To make a comments in SQL, use commenting dashes or blocks:

```sql
-- this is a comment

/*
This is a
multiline comment
*/
```

## Section IV- WHERE

### 4.1: Getting year 2010 records

```sql
SELECT * FROM station_data
WHERE year = 2010;
```

### 4.2: Getting non-2010 records

```sql
SELECT * FROM station_data
WHERE year != 2010;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM station_data
WHERE year <> 2010;
```

### 4.3: Getting records between 2005 and 2010

```sql
SELECT * FROM station_data
WHERE year BETWEEN 2005 AND 2010
```

### 4.4: Using `AND`

```sql
SELECT * FROM station_data
WHERE year >= 2005 AND year <= 2010
```

### 4.5: Exclusive Range

This will get the years between 2005 and 2010, but exclude 2005 and 2010

```sql
SELECT * FROM station_data
WHERE year > 2005 AND year < 2010
```

### 4.6: Using `OR`

```sql
SELECT * FROM station_data
WHERE MONTH = 3
OR MONTH = 6
OR MONTH = 9
OR MONTH = 12
```

### 4.7: Using `IN`

```sql
SELECT * FROM station_data
WHERE MONTH IN (3,6,9,12);
```

### 4.8: Using `NOT IN`

```sql
SELECT * FROM station_data
WHERE MONTH NOT IN (3,6,9,12);
```

### 4.9: Using Modulus

The modulus will perform division but return the remainder. So a remainder of 0 means the two numbers divide evenly.

```sql
SELECT * FROM station_data
WHERE MONTH % 3 = 0;
```

### 4.10: Using `WHERE` on TEXT

```sql
SELECT * FROM station_data
WHERE report_code = '513A63'
```

### 4.11: Using `IN` with text

```sql
SELECT * FROM station_data
WHERE report_code IN ('513A63','1F8A7B','EF616A')
```

### 4.12: Using `length()` function

```sql
SELECT * FROM station_data
WHERE length(report_code) != 6
```

### 4.13A: Using `LIKE` for any characters

```sql
SELECT * FROM station_data
WHERE report_code LIKE 'A%';
```

### 4.13B: Using Regular Expressions


If you are familiar with regular expressions, you can use those to identify and qualify text patterns.

```sql
SELECT * FROM STATION_DATA
WHERE report_code REGEXP '^A.*$'
```

### 4.14: Using `LIKE` for one character

```sql
SELECT * FROM station_data
WHERE report_code LIKE 'B_C%';
```

>For `LIKE`, `%` is used in a different context than modulus `%`

### 4.15: True Booleans 1

```sql
SELECT * FROM station_data
WHERE tornado = 1 AND hail = 1;
```

### 4.16: True Booleans 2

```sql
SELECT * FROM station_data
WHERE tornado AND hail
```

### 4.17: False Booleans 1

```sql
SELECT * FROM station_data
WHERE tornado = 0 AND hail = 1;
```

### 4.18: False Booleans 2

```sql
SELECT * FROM station_data
WHERE NOT tornado AND hail;
```

### 4.19: Handling `NULL`

A `NULL` is an absent value. It is not zero, empty text ' ', or any value. It is blank.

To check for a null value:

```sql
SELECT * FROM station_data
WHERE snow_depth IS NULL;
```


### 4.20: Handling `NULL` in conditions

Nulls will not qualify with any condition that doesn't explicitly handle it.

```sql
SELECT * FROM station_data
WHERE precipitation <= 0.5;
```

If you want to include nulls, do this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM station_data
WHERE precipitation IS NULL OR precipitation <= 0.5;
```

You can also use a `coalesce()` function to turn a null value into a default value, if it indeed is null.

This will treat all null values as a 0.

```sql
SELECT * FROM station_data
WHERE coalesce(precipitation, 0) <= 0.5;
```

### 4.21: Combining `AND` and `OR`

Querying for sleet or snow

Problematic. What belongs to the `AND` and what belongs to the `OR`?

```sql
SELECT * FROM station_data
WHERE rain = 1 AND temperature <= 32
OR snow_depth > 0;
```

You must group up the sleet condition in parenthesis so it is treated as one unit.

```sql
SELECT * FROM station_data
WHERE (rain = 1 AND temperature <= 32)
OR snow_depth > 0;
```

# Section V- GROUP BY and ORDER BY


### 5.1: Getting a count of records

```sql
SELECT count(*) as record_count FROM station_data
```

### 5.2 Getting a count of records with a condition

```sql
SELECT count(*) as record_count FROM station_data
WHERE tornado = 1
```

### 5.3 Getting a count by year

```sql
SELECT year, count(*) as record_count
FROM station_data
WHERE tornado = 1
GROUP BY year
```

### 5.4 Getting a count by year, month

```sql
SELECT year, month, count(*) as record_count
FROM station_data
WHERE tornado = 1
GROUP BY year, month
```

### 5.5 Getting a count by year, month with ordinal index

```sql
SELECT year, month, count(*) as record_count
FROM station_data
WHERE tornado = 1
GROUP BY 1, 2
```

### 5.6 Using ORDER BY

```sql
SELECT year, month, count(*) as record_count
FROM station_data
WHERE tornado = 1
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY year, month
```

### 5.7 Using ORDER BY with DESC

```sql
SELECT year, month, count(*) as record_count
FROM station_data
WHERE tornado = 1
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY year DESC, month
```

### 5.8 Counting non-null values

```sql
SELECT COUNT(snow_depth) as recorded_snow_depth_count
FROM station_data
```

### 5.9 Average temperature by month since year 2000

```sql
SELECT month, AVG(temperature) as avg_temp
FROM station_data
WHERE year >= 2000
GROUP BY month
```

### 5.10 Average temperature (with rounding) by month since year 2000


```sql
SELECT month, round(AVG(temperature),2) as avg_temp
FROM station_data
WHERE year >= 2000
GROUP BY month
```

### 5.11 Sum of snow depth

```sql
SELECT year, SUM(snow_depth) as total_snow
FROM station_data
WHERE year >= 2005
GROUP BY year
```

### 5.12 Multiple aggregations

```sql
SELECT year,
SUM(snow_depth) as total_snow,
SUM(precipitation) as total_precipitation,
MAX(precipitation) as max_precipitation

FROM station_data
WHERE year >= 2005
GROUP BY year
```

### EXERCISES
Flip to slides


### 5.13 Using HAVING

You cannot use WHERE on aggregations. This will result in an error.

```sql
SELECT year,
SUM(precipitation) as total_precipitation
FROM station_data
WHERE total_precipitation > 30
GROUP BY year
```

You can however, use HAVING.

```sql
SELECT year,
SUM(precipitation) as total_precipitation
FROM station_data
GROUP BY year
HAVING total_precipitation > 30
```

Note that some platforms like Oracle do not support aliasing in GROUP BY and HAVING.

Therefore you have to rewrite the entire expression each time

```sql
SELECT year,
SUM(precipitation) as total_precipitation
FROM station_data
GROUP BY year
HAVING SUM(precipitation) > 30
```


### 5.14 Getting Distinct values

You can get DISTINCT values for one or more columns

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT station_number FROM station_data
```

You can also get distinct combinations of values for multiple columns

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT station_number, year FROM station_data
```

# Section VI - CASE Statements

### 6.1 Categorizing Wind Speed

You can use a `CASE` statement to turn a column value into another value based on conditions. For instance, we can turn different `wind_speed` ranges into `HIGH`, `MODERATE`, and `LOW` categories.

```sql
SELECT report_code, year, month, day, wind_speed,

CASE
   WHEN wind_speed >= 40 THEN 'HIGH'
   WHEN wind_speed >= 30 AND wind_speed < 40 THEN 'MODERATE'
   ELSE 'LOW' END
AS wind_severity

FROM station_data
```

### 6.2 More Efficient Way To Categorize Wind Speed

We can actually omit `AND wind_speed < 40` from the previous example because each `WHEN`/`THEN` is evaluated from top-to-bottom. The first one it finds to be true is the one it will go with, and stop evaluating subsequent conditions.

```sql
SELECT report_code, year, month, day, wind_speed,

CASE
   WHEN wind_speed >= 40 THEN 'HIGH'
   WHEN wind_speed >= 30 THEN 'MODERATE'
   ELSE 'LOW'
END as wind_severity

FROM station_data
```

### 6.3 Using CASE with GROUP BY

We can use `GROUP BY` in conjunction with a `CASE` statement to slice data in more ways, such as getting the record count by `wind_severity`.

```sql
SELECT

CASE
    WHEN wind_speed >= 40 THEN 'HIGH'
    WHEN wind_speed >= 30 THEN 'MODERATE'
    ELSE 'LOW'
END AS wind_severity,

COUNT(*) AS record_count

FROM STATION_DATA

GROUP BY wind_severity
```

### 6.4 "Zero/Null" Case Trick

There is really no way to create multiple aggregations with different conditions unless you know a trick with the `CASE` statement. If you want to find two total precipitation, with and without tornado precipitations, for each year and month, you have to do separate queries.

**Tornado Precipitation**
```sql
SELECT year, month,
SUM(precipitation) as tornado_precipitation
FROM station_data
WHERE tornado = 1
AND year >= 1990
GROUP BY year, month
```

**Non-Tornado Precipitation**
```sql
SELECT year, month,
SUM(precipitation) as non_tornado_precipitation
FROM station_data
WHERE tornado = 0
AND year >= 1990
GROUP BY year, month
```

But you can use a single query using a `CASE` statement that sets a value to 0 if the condition is not met. That way it will not impact the sum.

```sql
SELECT year, month,
SUM(CASE WHEN tornado = 1 THEN precipitation ELSE 0 END) as tornado_precipitation,
SUM(CASE WHEN tornado = 0 THEN precipitation ELSE 0 END) as non_tornado_precipitation

FROM station_data
WHERE year >= 1990

GROUP BY year, month
```

Many folks who are not aware of the zero/null case trick will resort to derived tables (not covered in this class but covered in _Advanced SQL for Data Analysis_), which adds an unnecessary amount of effort and mess.

```sql
SELECT t.year,
t.month,
t.tornado_precipitation,
non_t.non_tornado_precipitation

FROM (
    SELECT year, month,
    SUM(precipitation) as tornado_precipitation
    FROM station_data
    WHERE tornado = 1
    AND year >= 1990
    GROUP BY year, month
) t

INNER JOIN

(
    SELECT year, month,
    SUM(precipitation) as non_tornado_precipitation
    FROM station_data
    WHERE tornado = 0
    AND year >= 1990
    GROUP BY year, month
) non_t
```

### 6.5 Using Null in a CASE to conditionalize MIN/MAX

Since `NULL` is ignored in SUM, MIN, MAX, and other aggregate functions, you can use it in a `CASE` statement to conditionally control whether or not a value should be included in that aggregation.

For instance, we can split up max precipitation when a tornado was present vs not present.

```sql
SELECT year,
MAX(CASE WHEN tornado = 0 THEN precipitation ELSE NULL END) as max_non_tornado_precipitation,
MAX(CASE WHEN tornado = 1 THEN precipitation ELSE NULL END) as max_tornado_precipitation
FROM station_data
WHERE year >= 1990
GROUP BY year
```

### Exercise 6.1

SELECT  the report_code, year, quarter, and temperature, where a “quarter” is “Q1”, “Q2”, “Q3”, or “Q4” reflecting months 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12 respectively.

**ANSWER:**

```sql
SELECT

report_code,
year,

CASE
    WHEN month BETWEEN 1 and 3 THEN 'Q1'
    WHEN month BETWEEN 4 and 6 THEN 'Q2'
    WHEN month BETWEEN 7 and 9 THEN 'Q3'
    WHEN month BETWEEN 10 and 12 THEN 'Q4'
END as quarter,

temperature

FROM STATION_DATA
```

### Exercise 6.2

Get the average temperature by quarter and month, where a “quarter” is “Q1”, “Q2”, “Q3”, or “Q4” reflecting months 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12 respectively.

**ANSWER**

```sql
SELECT
year,

CASE
    WHEN month BETWEEN 1 and 3 THEN 'Q1'
    WHEN month BETWEEN 4 and 6 THEN 'Q2'
    WHEN month BETWEEN 7 and 9 THEN 'Q3'
    WHEN month BETWEEN 10 and 12 THEN 'Q4'
END as quarter,

AVG(temperature) as avg_temp

FROM STATION_DATA
GROUP BY 1,2
```


# Section VII - JOIN

### 7.1A INNER JOIN

(Refer to slides Section VII)

View customer address information with each order by joining tables `CUSTOMER` and `CUSTOMER_ORDER`.

```sql
SELECT ORDER_ID,
CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID,
ORDER_DATE,
SHIP_DATE,
NAME,
STREET_ADDRESS,
CITY,
STATE,
ZIP,
PRODUCT_ID,
ORDER_QTY

FROM CUSTOMER INNER JOIN CUSTOMER_ORDER
ON CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID = CUSTOMER_ORDER.CUSTOMER_ID
```

Joins allow us to keep stored data normalized and simple, but we can get more descriptive views of our data by using joins.

Notice how two customers are omitted since they don't have any orders (refer to slides).


### 7.2B A BAD APPROACH

You may come across a style of joining where commas are used to select the needed tables, and a `WHERE` defines the join condition as shown below:

```sql
SELECT ORDER_ID,
CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID,
ORDER_DATE,
SHIP_DATE,
NAME,
STREET_ADDRESS,
CITY,
STATE,
ZIP,
PRODUCT_ID,
ORDER_QTY

FROM CUSTOMER, CUSTOMER_ORDER
WHERE CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID = CUSTOMER_ORDER.CUSTOMER_ID
```

Do not use this approach no matter how much your colleagues use it (and educate them not to use it either). It is extremely inefficient as it will generate a cartesian product across both tables (every possible combination of records between both), and then filter it based on the WHERE. It does not work with `LEFT JOIN` either, which we will look at shortly.

Using the `INNER JOIN` with an `ON` condition avoids the cartesian product and is more efficient. Therefore, always use that approach.

### 7.2 LEFT OUTER JOIN

To include all customers, regardless of whether they have orders, you can use a left outer join via `LEFT JOIN` (refer to slides).

If any customers do not have any orders, they will get one record where the `CUSTOMER_ORDER` fields will be null.

```sql
SELECT CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID,
NAME,
STREET_ADDRESS,
CITY,
STATE,
ZIP,
ORDER_DATE,
SHIP_DATE,
ORDER_ID,
PRODUCT_ID,
ORDER_QTY

FROM CUSTOMER LEFT JOIN CUSTOMER_ORDER
ON CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID = CUSTOMER_ORDER.CUSTOMER_ID
```


## 7.3 Finding Customers with No Orders

With a left outer join, you can filter for NULL values on the `CUSTOMER_ORDER` table to find customers that have no orders.

```sql
SELECT CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID,
NAME AS CUSTOMER_NAME

FROM CUSTOMER LEFT JOIN CUSTOMER_ORDER
ON CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID = CUSTOMER_ORDER.CUSTOMER_ID

WHERE ORDER_ID IS NULL
```

You can use a left outer join to find child records with no parent, or parent records with no children (e.g. a `CUSTOMER_ORDER` with no `CUSTOMER`, or a `CUSTOMER` with no `CUSTOMER_ORDER`s).


## 7.4 Joining Multiple Tables

Bring in `PRODUCT` to supply product information for each `CUSTOMER_ORDER`, on top of `CUSTOMER` information.

```sql
SELECT ORDER_ID,
CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID,
NAME AS CUSTOMER_NAME,
STREET_ADDRESS,
CITY,
STATE,
ZIP,
ORDER_DATE,
PRODUCT.PRODUCT_ID,
DESCRIPTION,
ORDER_QTY

FROM CUSTOMER INNER JOIN CUSTOMER_ORDER
ON CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID = CUSTOMER_ORDER.CUSTOMER_ID

INNER JOIN PRODUCT
ON CUSTOMER_ORDER.PRODUCT_ID = PRODUCT.PRODUCT_ID
```

## 7.7 Using Expressions with JOINs

You can use expressions combining any fields on any of the joined tables. For instance, we can now get the total revenue for each customer.

```sql
SELECT ORDER_ID,
CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID,
NAME AS CUSTOMER_NAME,
STREET_ADDRESS,
CITY,
STATE,
ZIP,
ORDER_DATE,
PRODUCT.PRODUCT_ID,
DESCRIPTION,
ORDER_QTY,
ORDER_QTY * PRICE as REVENUE

FROM CUSTOMER INNER JOIN CUSTOMER_ORDER
ON CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID = CUSTOMER_ORDER.CUSTOMER_ID

INNER JOIN PRODUCT
ON CUSTOMER_ORDER.PRODUCT_ID = PRODUCT.PRODUCT_ID
```


## 7.6 Using GROUP BY with JOINs

You can use `GROUP BY` with a join. For instance, you can find the total revenue for each customer by leveraging all three joined tables, and aggregating the `REVENUE` expression we created earlier.

```sql
SELECT
CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID,
NAME AS CUSTOMER_NAME,
sum(ORDER_QTY * PRICE) as TOTAL_REVENUE

FROM CUSTOMER INNER JOIN CUSTOMER_ORDER
ON CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID = CUSTOMER_ORDER.CUSTOMER_ID

INNER JOIN PRODUCT
ON CUSTOMER_ORDER.PRODUCT_ID = PRODUCT.PRODUCT_ID

GROUP BY 1,2
```

To see all customers even if they had no orders, use a `LEFT JOIN`

```sql
SELECT
CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID,
NAME AS CUSTOMER_NAME,
sum(ORDER_QTY * PRICE) as TOTAL_REVENUE

FROM CUSTOMER LEFT JOIN CUSTOMER_ORDER
ON CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID = CUSTOMER_ORDER.CUSTOMER_ID

LEFT JOIN PRODUCT
ON CUSTOMER_ORDER.PRODUCT_ID = PRODUCT.PRODUCT_ID

GROUP BY 1,2
```

You can also use a `coalesce()` function to turn null sums into zeros.

```sql
SELECT
CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID,
NAME AS CUSTOMER_NAME,
coalesce(sum(ORDER_QTY * PRICE), 0) as TOTAL_REVENUE

FROM CUSTOMER LEFT JOIN CUSTOMER_ORDER
ON CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID = CUSTOMER_ORDER.CUSTOMER_ID

LEFT JOIN PRODUCT
ON CUSTOMER_ORDER.PRODUCT_ID = PRODUCT.PRODUCT_ID

GROUP BY 1,2
```
# Section VIII - Database Design

Refer to slides for database design concepts

To view source code for SQL Injection Demo, here is the GitHub page:

To read about normalized forms (which we do not cover in favor of a more intuitive approach), you can read this article:

http://www.dummies.com/programming/sql/sql-first-second-and-third-normal-forms/


## 7.1 - Creating a Table

In SQLiteStudio, navigate to *Database* -> *Add a Database* and click the green plus icon to create a new database. Choose a location and name it `surgetech_conference.db`.

Create the `COMPANY` table. To create a new table, use the SQLiteStudio wizard by right-clicking the `surgetech_conference` database and selecting `Create a table`. You can also just execute the following SQL.

```sql
CREATE TABLE COMPANY (
  COMPANY_ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  NAME VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  DESCRIPTION VARCHAR(60),
  PRIMARY_CONTACT_ATTENDEE_ID INTEGER NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (PRIMARY_CONTACT_ATTENDEE_ID) REFERENCES ATTENDEE(ATTENDEE_ID)
);
```

After each field declaration, we create "rules" for that field. For example, `COMPANY_ID` must be an `INTEGER`, it is a `PRIMARY KEY`, and it will `AUTOINCREMENT` to automatically generate a consecutive integer ID for each new record. The `NAME` field holds text because it is `VARCHAR` (a variable number of characters), and it is limited to 30 characters and cannot be `NULL`.

Lastly, we declare any `FOREIGN KEY` constraints, specifying which field is a `FOREIGN KEY` and what `PRIMARY KEY` it references. In this example, `PRIMARY_CONTACT_ATTENDEE_ID` "references" the `ATTENDEE_ID` in the `ATTENDEE` table, and it can only be those values.

## 7.2 - Creating the other tables

Create the other tables using the SQLiteStudio *New table* wizard, or just executing the following SQL code.

```sql
CREATE TABLE ROOM (
  ROOM_ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  FLOOR_NUMBER INTEGER NOT NULL,
  SEAT_CAPACITY INTEGER NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE PRESENTATION (
  PRESENTATION_ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  BOOKED_COMPANY_ID INTEGER NOT NULL,
  BOOKED_ROOM_ID INTEGER NOT NULL,
  START_TIME TIME,
  END_TIME TIME,
  FOREIGN KEY (BOOKED_COMPANY_ID) REFERENCES COMPANY(COMPANY_ID)
  FOREIGN KEY (BOOKED_ROOM_ID) REFERENCES ROOM(ROOM_ID)
);

CREATE TABLE ATTENDEE (
   ATTENDEE_ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
   FIRST_NAME VARCHAR (30) NOT NULL,
   LAST_NAME VARCHAR (30) NOT NULL,
   PHONE INTEGER,
   EMAIL VARCHAR (30),
   VIP BOOLEAN DEFAULT (0)
);

CREATE TABLE PRESENTATION_ATTENDANCE (
  TICKET_ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  PRESENTATION_ID INTEGER,
  ATTENDEE_ID INTEGER,
  FOREIGN KEY (PRESENTATION_ID) REFERENCES PRESENTATION(PRESENTATION_ID)
  FOREIGN KEY (ATTENDEE_ID) REFERENCES ATTENDEE(ATTENDEE_ID)
);
```

## Creating Views

It is not uncommon to save `SELECT` queries that are used frequently into a database. These are known as **Views** and act very similarly to tables. You can essentially save a `SELECT` query and work with it just like a table.

For instance, say we wanted to save this SQL query that includes `ROOM` and `COMPANY` info with each `PRESENTATION` record.

```sql
SELECT COMPANY.NAME as BOOKED_COMPANY,
ROOM.ROOM_ID as ROOM_NUMBER,
ROOM.FLOOR_NUMBER as FLOOR,
ROOM.SEAT_CAPACITY as SEATS,
START_TIME, END_TIME

FROM PRESENTATION

INNER JOIN COMPANY
ON PRESENTATION.BOOKED_COMPANY_ID = COMPANY.COMPANY_ID

INNER JOIN ROOM
ON PRESENTATION.BOOKED_ROOM_ID = ROOM.ROOM_ID
```

You can save this as a view by right-clicking *Views* in the database navigator, and then *Create a view*. You can then paste the SQL as the body and give the view a name, such as `PRESENTATION_VW` (where "VW" means "View").

You can also just execute the following SQL syntax: `CREATE [view name]  AS [a SELECT query]`. For this example, this is what it would look like.

```sql
CREATE VIEW PRESENTATION_VW AS

SELECT COMPANY.NAME as BOOKED_COMPANY,
ROOM.ROOM_ID as ROOM_NUMBER,
ROOM.FLOOR_NUMBER as FLOOR,
ROOM.SEAT_CAPACITY as SEATS,
START_TIME, END_TIME

FROM PRESENTATION

INNER JOIN COMPANY
ON PRESENTATION.BOOKED_COMPANY_ID = COMPANY.COMPANY_ID

INNER JOIN ROOM
ON PRESENTATION.BOOKED_ROOM_ID = ROOM.ROOM_ID
```

You will then see the `PRESENTATION_VW` in your database navigator, and you can query it just like a table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM PRESENTATION_VW
WHERE SEATS >= 30
```

Obviously, there is no data yet so you will not get any results. But there will be once you populate data into this database.

# Section IX - Writing Data

In this section, we will learn how to write, modify, and delete data in a database.


## 9.1 Using `INSERT`

To create a new record in a table, use the `INSERT` command and supply the values for the needed columns.

Put yourself into the `ATTENDEE` table.

```sql
INSERT INTO ATTENDEE (FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME)
VALUES ('Thomas','Nield')
```

Notice above that we declare the table we are writing to, which is `ATTENDEE`. Then we declare the columns we are supplying values for `(FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME)`, followed by the values for this new record `('Thomas','Nield')`.

Notice we did not have to supply a value for `ATTENDEE_ID` as we have set it in the previous section to generate its own value. `PHONE`, `EMAIL`, and `VIP` fields have default values or are nullable, and therefore optional.


## 9.2 Multiple `INSERT` records

You can insert multiple rows in an `INSERT`. This will add three people to the `ATTENDEE` table.

```sql
INSERT INTO ATTENDEE (FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, PHONE, EMAIL, VIP)
VALUES ('Jon', 'Skeeter', 4802185842,'john.skeeter@rex.net', 1),
  ('Sam','Scala', 2156783401,'sam.scala@gmail.com', 0),
  ('Brittany','Fisher', 5932857296,'brittany.fisher@outlook.com', 0)
```

## 9.3 Testing the foreign keys

Let's test our design and make sure our primary/foreign keys are working.

Try to `INSERT` a `COMPANY` with a `PRIMARY_CONTACT_ATTENDEE_ID` that does not exist in the `ATTENDEE` table.

```sql
INSERT INTO COMPANY (NAME, DESCRIPTION, PRIMARY_CONTACT_ATTENDEE_ID)
VALUES ('RexApp Solutions','A mobile app delivery service', 5)
```

Currently, there is no `ATTENDEE` with an `ATTENDEE_ID` of 5, this should error out which is good. It means we kept bad data out.

If you use an `ATTENDEE_ID` value that does exist and supply it as a `PRIMARY_CONTACT_ATTENDEE_ID`, we should be good to go.

```sql
INSERT INTO COMPANY (NAME, DESCRIPTION, PRIMARY_CONTACT_ATTENDEE_ID)
VALUES ('RexApp Solutions', 'A mobile app delivery service', 3)
```

### 9.3 `DELETE` records

The `DELETE` command is dangerously simple. To delete records from both the `COMPANY` and `ATTENDEE` tables, execute the following SQL commands.

```sql
DELETE FROM COMPANY;
DELETE FROM ATTENDEE;
```

Note that the `COMPANY` table has a foreign key relationship with the `ATTENDEE` table. Therefore we will have to delete records from `COMPANY` first before it allows us to delete data from `ATTENDEE`. Otherwise we will get a "FOREIGN KEY constraint failed effort" due to the `COMPANY` record we just added which is tied to the `ATTENDEE` with the `ATTENDEE_ID` of 3.

You can also use a `WHERE` to only delete records that meet a conditional. To delete all `ATTENDEE` records with no `PHONE` or `EMAIL`, you can run this command.

```sql
DELETE FROM ATTENDEE
WHERE PHONE IS NULL AND EMAIL IS NULL
```

A good practice is to use a `SELECT *` in place of the `DELETE` first. That way you can get a preview of what records will be deleted with that `WHERE` condition.


```sql
SELECT * FROM ATTENDEE
WHERE PHONE IS NULL AND EMAIL IS NULL
```

### `UPDATE` records

Say we wanted to change the phone number for the `ATTENDEE` with the `ATTENDEE_ID` value of 3, which is Sam Scala. We can do this with an `UPDATE` statement.

```sql
UPDATE ATTENDEE SET PHONE = 4802735872
WHERE ATTENDEE_ID = 3
```

Using a `WHERE` is important, otherwise it will update all records with the specified `SET` assignment. This can be handy if you wanted to say, make all `EMAIL` values uppercase.

```sql
UPDATE ATTENDEE SET EMAIL = UPPER(EMAIL)
```

### 9.4 Dropping Tables

If you want to delete a table, it also is dangerously simple. Be very careful and sure before you delete any table, because it will remove it permanently.

```sql
DROP TABLE MY_UNWANTED_TABLE
```

### 9.5 Transactions

Transactions are helpful when you want a series of writes to succeed.


Below, we execute two successful write operations within a transaction.

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO ROOM (FLOOR_NUMBER, SEAT_CAPACITY) VALUES (9, 80);
INSERT INTO ROOM (FLOOR_NUMBER, SEAT_CAPACITY) VALUES (10, 110);

END TRANSACTION;
```

But if we ever encountered a failure with our write operations, we can call `ROLLBACK` instead of `END TRANSACTION` to go back to the database state when `BEGIN TRANSACTION` was called.

Below, we have a failed operation due to a broken `INSERT`.

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO ROOM (FLOOR_NUMBER, SEAT_CAPACITY) VALUES (12, 210);
INSERT INTO ROOM (FLOOR_NUMBER, SEAT_CAPACITY) VALUES (13); --failure
```

So we can call `ROLLBACK` to "rewind" to the database state when `BEGIN TRANSACTION` was called.

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

### 9.6 Creating Indexes

You can create an index on a certain column to speed up SELECT performance, such as the `price` column on the `PRODUCT` table.

```sql
CREATE INDEX price_index ON PRODUCT(price);
```

You can also create an index for a column that has unique values, and it will make a special optimization for that case.

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX name_index ON CUSTOMER(name);
```

To remove an index, use the `DROP` command.

```sql
DROP INDEX price_index;
```


### 9.7 Working with Dates and Times

Use the ISO 'yyyy-mm-dd' syntax with strings to treat them as dates easily.

Keep in mind much of this functionality is proprietary to SQLite. Make sure you learn the date and time functionality for your specific database platform.

```sql
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER_ORDER
WHERE SHIP_DATE < '2015-05-21'
```

To get today's date:

```sql
SELECT DATE('now')
```

To shift a date:

```sql
SELECT DATE('now','-1 day')
SELECT DATE('2015-12-07','+3 month','-1 day')
```

To work with times, use `hh:mm:ss` format.

```sql
SELECT '16:31' < '08:31'
```

To get today's GMT time:

```sql
SELECT TIME('now')
```

To shift a time:

```sql
SELECT TIME('16:31','+1 minute')
```

To merge a date and time, use a DateTime type.

```sql
SELECT '2015-12-13 16:04:11'
SELECT DATETIME('2015-12-13 16:04:11','-1 day','+3 hour')
```

To format dates and times a certain way:  

``sql
SELECT strftime('%d-%m-%Y', 'now')
```
